        <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
        <p>I'm Shanur Mursalin Simanto, a passionate and adaptable individual with a strong foundation in computer science and engineering, currently pursuing my BSc at the State University of Bangladesh. My journey has been enriched by a blend of academic excellence and hands-on professional experiences in teaching, sales, and management. I thrive in dynamic environments where problem-solving, leadership, and communication are key.

            With a background that includes roles such as Junior Executive, Management Trainee, Assistant Teacher, and Sales Representative, I’ve developed a broad skill set spanning team leadership, customer relationship management, and technical proficiencies in Python, C, HTML, and CSS. I’m also well-versed in MS Office tools, making me both a technical and organizational asset.

            I’ve received scholarships since the beginning of my undergraduate program and earned certifications including IELTS and a Master Class Participant Diploma from the International Documentary Film Festival.

            As someone who is hardworking, ethical, and adaptive, I am always seeking opportunities to contribute, grow, and make a meaningful impact.
